# PitchPerfect
## iOS app written in Swift that record audio input from user and play it back in different pitches


* What I have learnt and gone through by working and completing this project --
* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Search documentation (UIViewController, AVAudioRecording...), resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
