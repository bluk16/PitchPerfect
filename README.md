# PitchPerfect
First iOS app that record audio input from user and play it back in different pitch

Learnt iOS development from Udacity. 

⋅⋅* What I have learnt and gone through by working and completing this project --
⋅⋅* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
⋅⋅* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
⋅⋅* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
⋅⋅* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
⋅⋅* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
⋅⋅* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
⋅⋅* Search documentation (UIViewController, AVAudioRecording...), resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
